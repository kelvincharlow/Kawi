# Digital Fleet Management System - Limitations & Future Enhancements

## Current System Limitations

### 1. **Authentication & Security Limitations**

#### Current Issues:
- **Basic Authentication**: Simple localStorage-based sessions without proper JWT implementation
- **Default Passwords**: Development credentials (`admin`/`admin123`) in production
- **No Password Policies**: No complexity requirements or expiration policies
- **Limited Role Management**: Only Admin/Driver roles, no granular permissions
- **Client-side Security**: Authentication state stored in localStorage (vulnerable to XSS)

#### Security Risks:
- Session hijacking potential
- No multi-factor authentication
- No audit trail for user actions
- No rate limiting on API calls

---

### 2. **Data Management Limitations**

#### Current Issues:
- **Mock Data Dependency**: System primarily runs on localStorage with limited live database integration
- **No Data Validation**: Limited server-side validation for data integrity
- **No Backup Strategy**: Data stored locally without cloud backup
- **Limited Scalability**: localStorage has size limitations (5-10MB)
- **No Data Versioning**: No history tracking for record changes

#### Data Integrity Risks:
- Data loss on browser cache clear
- No synchronization between multiple users
- No conflict resolution for concurrent edits

---

### 3. **Real-time Features Missing**

#### Current Gaps:

- **No Notifications**: No alerts for maintenance due dates, license expiry
- **No GPS Integration**: No real-time vehicle tracking
- **No Communication**: No in-app messaging between drivers and admins
- **No Live Dashboard**: Statistics don't update automatically

---

### 4. **Reporting & Analytics Limitations**

#### Current Issues:
- **Static Reports**: No dynamic filtering or drill-down capabilities
- **Limited Export Options**: Basic CSV/JSON export only
- **No Scheduled Reports**: No automated report generation
- **No Data Visualization**: Limited charts and graphs
- **No Predictive Analytics**: No forecasting or trend analysis

#### Missing Report Types:
- Fuel efficiency analysis

---

### 6. **Integration Limitations**

#### Missing Integrations:
- **No GPS/Telematics**: No vehicle tracking systems
- **No Fuel Card Integration**: Manual fuel record entry
- **No Government Systems**: No integration with licensing authorities
- **No Insurance APIs**: Manual insurance tracking
- **No Maintenance Provider APIs**: No automated service booking

---

### 7. **Workflow & Process Limitations**

#### Current Gaps:
- **Manual Processes**: Most workflows require manual intervention
